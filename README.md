## Template_Design
This project is a design based one. I used standard HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT to design this beautiful template and this design is inspired from the website [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/)
## Live Demo
This project is deployed in github. Please visit (https://prasathravichandran.github.io/Template_Design/) or click [LIVE DEMO](https://prasathravichandran.github.io/Template_Design/) to preview the webpage design.
## Platform
This template is developed using HTML5, CSS3, [Bootstrap(4.3.1)](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/) and I used JavaScript libraries like [Flickity](https://flickity.metafizzy.co/), [Slick slider](https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/). For IDE, I used [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
## Development Server
Run `npm i live-server -g` to install [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) package globally in your computer. Navigate to your project folder and run `live-server`. The app will automatically open `http://127.0.0.1:8080` in the browser and it reload if you change any of the source files.
